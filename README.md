# Natural_Language_Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a massive field of study that use statistics and computers to apply prediction for example for **topic identification**, **text classification**, **chatbots**, **translation** and **sentiment analysis** and so forth. This notebook presents word processing including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, work frequency, named entity recognition (NER) and how to apply NLP supervised learning to detect fake/real news.


Python functions and data files to run this notebook is in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Natural_Language_Processing.git) page.
